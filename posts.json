			"So early this week I was writing some random code, and I thought to myself, I have a ton of dead code thats going nowhere, so I came up with a solution.",
			"Just push everything to github, the good, the bad and the ugly. I then decided to expand on this, write some piece of code and publish it every day for a year.",
			"My rules for this challenge are simple, write any code each day, it can be a new project or an addition to a project. As long as something new is added each day.",
			"I'm 7 days in now and I'm barely scratching the surface of what I want to be doing, with a tiny amount of java and a lot of nodejs, I'll need to start mixing it up soon too!",
			"So watch this space for a mix of servers, random crawlers, exploits and whatever else I can come up with."
